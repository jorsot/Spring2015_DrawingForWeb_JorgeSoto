<h1 style="text-align: center;">Final Project - Proposal</h1>

<p>
  For our final project, we plan to make a dynamic, interactive, browser-based Call Sheet template for film productions. A call sheet shows a crew or cast member in a film production all the necessary information about a shoot day: schedule for each set-up, times for crew members to show up, crew contact information, weather forecasts, nearest hospital information, advanced schedule (of next day) and other key things everyone might need to know for that day. Being film students, we've both experienced a lot of call sheets, even making our own automated templates using intricate spreadsheet functions throughout various sheets, and want to try making a web-based one as an experiment. We want to see if it would actually help a production. The call sheet could then be updated live with current information and respond dynamically to recent developments or user actions. Below are some possible features to implement:</p>
  <p>We plan to use color in a way that communicates current information at a glance to the user. For example, with weather, in addition to just showing the forecast for the day, our call sheet would include the current temperature, and maybe the next hour's forecast, with the element changing color to reflect the temperature.</p>
  <p>Also based on the time of day and the schedule, we can change the colors of items in the past, and reflect if we are behind or ahead of schedule.</p>
  <p>Usually in call sheets you have a table of the entire crew and their contact info, and it can seem unwieldly and hard to navigate. With our mobile version we hope to use JavaScript (and nice CSS animations and hover classes to make it classy) to enable the user to simply see a list of crew members / positions, and click or tap on them to expand or reveal the relevant contact info.</p>
  <p>The majority of the project will be built with javascript and css. Icons will be built in Illustrator and exported as SVGs to ensure scalability between platforms. Finally we will use GitHub to collaborate effectively between our two computers.</p>
